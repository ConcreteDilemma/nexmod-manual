    <h1>Chapter 1: System Purpose</h1>

    <h2>1.1 Purpose Statement</h2>
    <p>The NEX-MOD Type 1 Interface System is not designed to serve a single function. Its utility is contextual, interpretive, and dependent on the absence of urgency. Users are discouraged from assuming any one task will be completed. Instead, the device functions as a passive support structure for unresolved operations.</p>

    <h2>1.2 Intended Use</h2>
    <p>Intended use includes moments of indeterminate focus, passive observation, and soft interrogation of systems without known outcomes. It is acceptable to leave the device powered while not in use. In many cases, this is recommended. Any form of prolonged intent may degrade stability. The system performs best in atmospheres of hesitation, speculative memory, and ambient attention.</p>

    <h2>1.3 Warning: Do not expose device to intention</h2>
    <p>Do not expose the device to intention. The system interprets strong will as structural interference. This can result in partial boot, recursive state, or mode confusion. If intention has been applied, allow the system to idle and recede. Do not apologise. Do not explain.</p>
